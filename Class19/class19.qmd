```{r}
library (bio3d)
```


```{r}
cancer_fasta <- read.fasta("A18024184_mutant_seq.fa")
```

```{r}
cancer_fasta
```

Find the one where it's not the same between the two.
```{r}
muts <- which(conserv(cancer_fasta) < 1)
```

To see each amino acid that is non-conserved, identified by  `muts` above:
```{r}
cancer_fasta$ali[, muts]

```

Now, we know that the following amino acid in these specified vector position are:

- Y806V
- Y900E
- L923R
- G938Y

# for the Alphafold result

```{r}
AF_file <- list.files(path="class19_92203/",
                      pattern=".a3m$",
                      full.names = TRUE)
AF_file
AF_algn <- read.fasta(AF_file[1], to.upper = T)
dim(AF_algn$ali)
```


Here, we are looking at the conserved regions, at a cutoff of 0.6
```{r}
# look for conserved region
con <- consensus(AF_algn, cutoff = 0.6)
con$seq
```
