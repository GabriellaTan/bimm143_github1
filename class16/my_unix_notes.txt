Nano is a very basic text editor. It's also available everywhere!

----------------------------------------------------------------
Learning UNIX:

- pwd: print working directory -- where you're at.
- cd: to move between directories.
- ls: know what's there (in the directory you're at).
- rm: BE CAREFUL, will remove stuff forever and ever.
- nano: very tiny text editor. It is in whatever machine u're at. 
        You can type texts here :D
        To get out of nano, you can press CONTROL(^) + X.
- mkdir: make directory -- to make a new folder!

----------------------------------------------------------------

Unix is reaaally good at opening Text files, it doesn't have to load up the 
whole file to get something.

You can use: 
`head` or `tail` to preview some of the file!

IMPORTANT COMMAND to preview the whole file: `less` 
It is to see the whole document, page-by-page! 
Click Space bar to go page by page. we can get out of the `less` 
by pressing q (like nano). 

-----------------------------------------------------------------
- head: preview first few lines (determine by writing -(somenumber))
- tail: preview last few lines (determine by writing -(somenumber))
- less: preview the whole document, page-by-page. "Less is More" type ahh.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

 		 HIERARCHICAL ORGANIZATION OF THE UNIX STRUCTURE
The root of the file system is the base of your computer -- probably hard drive. 
Then, there are directories where they branches. 

When you pwd, it'll give u the path to where you're at. 
If we are at the User/abel page, when you type in the `cd Desktop` you can go to 
the directory because it's a subdirectory of where you were at --> RELATIVE path. 
`pwd` command will give u the ABSOLUTE path. This will allow you to move anywhere 
from anywhere. 

--------------------------- USEFUL SHORTCUTS ---------------------------------
                          
- [TAB] : autocomplete whatever you type as long as it's unique from the others.
- ~   : home area
- ../ : dropping to "parent" directory (the one before yours!)
- *[.gz]: Wild Card to get all the things that contains whatever you put after it (i.e., .gz).
- >   : pipe, to get the results into a file (can be a faa file or a text file!)
